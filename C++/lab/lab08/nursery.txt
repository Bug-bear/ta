Jack and Jill went up the hill
To fetch a pail of water
Jack fell down and broke his crown 
And Jill came tumbling after
Mary had a little lamb
Its fleece was white as snow
And everywhere that Mary went
That lamb was sure to go
Hickory Dickory Dock
The mouse ran up the clock
The clock struck one
The mouse ran down
Hickory Dickory Dock
